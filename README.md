# VHDL Ultrasonic Car Parking Sensor

Implemented an ultrasonic sensor to measure and visualize distances on the Nexys 4 DDR FPGA 7-seg Display and LEDs.
Incorporated a buzzer that sounds according to proximity by using a single multiplexed clock signal.

Please note that the sensor needs 5V and the Nexys 4 is only able to give 3.3V. Use a booster or an external power supply.
